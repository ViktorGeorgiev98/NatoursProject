/* !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    Always convert px to REM, that is making design easier to work with.
    1 rem = 10px
    Default font size is 16px
    Always set it in the html tag
    It makes responsive web design very easy, because when you change the font size
    in the html tag you will change the size of everything because
    it is relative!!!!!
    Always set it as percentage, not hardcoded value!!!!
    divide 10/16 = 62.5% and use that!!!!!!
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
